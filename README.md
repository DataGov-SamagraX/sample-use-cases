## Learning Passbook 

The learning Passbook is a comprehensive student record that tracks any assessment/project that counts towards a students' academic standing and showcases the same effectively to students/teachers/mentors/govt officals at various aggregated levels to drive decision making 

This is expanded in the 2nd phase to include ML enabled use cases like:
- Personalized recommendations for the students(to learn)
- Personalized recommendations for the teachers(to teach)
- Student drop out risk warnings
- Student grade level warnings
